This little project is a showcase of how I work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

This version is in french because it was asked me to do it. I have no problem with writing in English as well.

The javascript app that you see here is to reorder the phrases that are longer than 3 and less the 10 words. Signs as: . , ! ? ; do not count as words unless they are joined to a word.
